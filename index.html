    <aside>Cleaning: Depending on how many fish you have, and how messy they are, most tanks require cleaning about once every two weeks. Cleaning should involve: ✔ Siphoning the gravel to remove any debris and uneaten food, and changing about 10-15% of the water. ✔ Check the filter is working correctly</aside>
    <aside>Salinity: As low as 1.023 and as high as 1.028 are generally considered safe for corals, however, most hobbyists keep their salinity in the range of 1.024 and 1.026 (32 to 35 ppt). Generally only used for aquariums with saltwater fish as the salinity is too low for the vast majority of corals.</aside>
    <aside>Temperature: Most tank fish do well at temperatures from 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit (23-27 degrees Celsius), but the needs of specific fish can vary.</section>
